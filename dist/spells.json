maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature.<br> The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level.<br> If you succeed on a

monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level.<br> If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own.<br> A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the

masterwork sword, in fact).<br> Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.<br>Area Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.<br>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel

caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.<br>Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect).<br> By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.<br> Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord.<br> This use of the spell creates

service.<br> The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards.<br> (Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.<br>) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward.<br> After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.<br>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by

spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface.<br> When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.<br> The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.<br> Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first.<br> Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.<br> A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.<br>Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).<br> To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.<br> Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.<br>As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.<br> Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).<br> Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.<br>In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.<br> Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.<br> You can’t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.<br> Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.<br>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.<br> These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.<br> Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.<br> Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.<br> When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.<br> Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.<br> If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.<br>You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.<br> Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.<br> Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.<br> Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer.<br> Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.<br> You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.<br>Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.<br> Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.<br>A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.<br> An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.<br> Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.<br>Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.<br> A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.<br>Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.<br> A

dispelled.<br> Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.<br>• Remove injuries and afflictions.<br> A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.<br> For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish.<br> A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.<br>• Revive the dead.<br> A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell.<br> A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again.<br> A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.<br>• Transport travelers.<br> A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions.<br> An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.<br>• Undo misfortune.<br> A wish can undo a single recent event.<br> The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn).<br> Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result.<br> For example, a wish could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on.<br> The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll.<br> An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.<br>You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.<br> (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.<br>)Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).<br>","name":"Wish","castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"See text","materialComponents":"When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs
